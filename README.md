# nimLoader
Load dumped Csharp binaries as assemblies and launch them in memory bypassing AMSI and ETW.

This tool is deeply inspired by @s3cur3th1ssh1t and @Byt3bl33d3r work on Nim, and the  [Invoke-Sharploader](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Invoke-SharpLoader) and [netLoader](https://github.com/Flangvik/NetLoader) tools.

# Use
This tool is actually three:
## CsharpToNimByteArray
This is a slight modification of the tool described at https://s3cur3th1ssh1t.github.io/Playing-with-OffensiveNim
It dumps a Csharp tool's bytes to a txt file.

## nimCrypter
a tool to encrypt/decript files

## nimLoader
The main tool that loads dumped/encrypted files from file or url
