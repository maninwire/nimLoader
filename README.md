# nimLoader
Load dumped Csharp binaries as assemblies and launch them in memory.

This tool is deeply inspired by @s3cur3th1ssh1t and @Byt3bl33d3r work on Nim, and the  [Invoke-Sharploader](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Invoke-SharpLoader) and [netLoader](https://github.com/Flangvik/NetLoader) tools.

## nimCrypter
a tool to encrypt/decript files
## nimLoader
